CROSSROADS: A MAN'S TRAVAIL
A Modern Parable of Faith, Fracture, and Forgiveness

THE LOGLINE:
A devout Nigerian family man, shattered by financial ruin and marital collapse, is offered a lucrative path out of despair by a seductive executive—if he abandons the integrity that defines him. His choice will either save his family or destroy his soul.

THE COMP:
The Pursuit of Happyness meets Fireproof meets Parasite. A visceral, faith-based psychological drama with the global appeal of a thriller.

THE HOOK:
The Uber Revelation. Our protagonist is literally in the backseat of a car, on his way to commit a life-altering sin, when a stranger's phone call becomes a divine intervention. This is the unignorable, water-cooler moment that will define the film's marketing campaign.

THE VISUAL LANGUAGE:
Cinematic Contrast. The gritty, naturalistic texture of the Ethan household versus the sleek, cold, blue-tinged allure of the corporate world. The camera moves from handheld and intimate to steady and seductive, mirroring the protagonist's internal battle.

THE CORE CONFLICT:
This is not a story of good vs. evil. It is a story of Desperation vs. Principle, Grace vs. Karma, and the World's Solution vs. God's Silence. It explores the terrifying question: "Why do the wicked prosper, and why does obedience often lead to suffering?"

THE AUDIENCE:
The massive, underserved global faith-based market, plus the A24/NEON audience that craves authentic, international, auteur-driven stories. This is a bridge film.

THE UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION:
Authentic Cultural Specificity as a Universal Language. The film is unapologetically Nigerian—its languages, its settings, its rhythms. This is not a weakness but its greatest strength, offering a fresh, vibrant window into a universal human struggle. It is Parasite for the soul.

THE TALENT (Attached):
Writer/Director: [Your Name/Your Director's Name], a visionary new voice bringing an authentic, uncompromising perspective to global cinema.

Lead (Dili): To be cast. A formidable actor capable of conveying profound internal conflict with minimal dialogue. (A Chiwetel Ejiofor or David Oyelowo archetype).

Lead (Zaram): To be cast. A renowned Nollywood actress who can embody regal beauty, cutting scorn, and raw vulnerability.

The Prestige Path: A strategic theatrical qualifying run for major awards consideration.

The Digital Blitz: A high-impact free YouTube release to drive tens of millions of views.

THE LEGACY:
More than a movie, CROSSROADS is a cultural touchstone. It will be a discipleship tool, a marriage counseling resource, and a beacon of hope, proving that faith-based cinema can be as cinematically powerful and critically acclaimed as any mainstream drama.

"A flawless, devastating, and ultimately triumphant exploration of the cost of discipleship in the modern world. This isn't a sermon; it's a masterpiece."
